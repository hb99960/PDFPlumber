### 1. Introduction

#### 1.1 Purpose
This PRD outlines the requirements for developing a "PDF Event Schedule Extractor" project. The primary goal is to create a system that can ingest PDF documents, specifically event brochures, and extract a structured event schedule based on a provided prompt. The extracted information will include date, time slots, session/activity name, speaker/organizer, and location/venue, presented in a clean, readable format.

#### 1.2 Scope
This project focuses on extracting event schedules from *event brochures* in PDF format. It will handle both text-based and image-based PDFs by leveraging OCR capabilities. The output will be a compiled, chronological list of events, ideally in a tabular format. Future enhancements (out of scope for this initial phase) could include support for other document types, advanced natural language understanding for more complex schedule variations, or direct integration with calendar applications.

* Be robust enough to handle variations in PDF layouts and content presentation.

### 3. User Stories

#### 3.1 Primary User (Event Organizer/Administrator)
* As an event organizer, I want to upload a PDF event brochure so that I can quickly extract the full event schedule.
* As an event organizer, I want the system to identify all sessions, talks, breaks, and keynotes, so that I don't miss any important agenda items.
* As an event organizer, I want the extracted schedule to include dates, times, session names, speakers, and locations, so that I have complete information.
* As an event organizer, I want the schedule to be compiled chronologically, even if it's spread across multiple pages, so that I have a single, coherent view.
* As an event organizer, I want the output to be in a readable table or list format, so that I can easily review and use the information.

#### 3.2 Secondary User (Attendee/Information Seeker - potentially out of scope for initial direct interaction, but benefits from the output)
* As an attendee, I want a clear and concise event schedule extracted from the brochure so that I can plan my attendance effectively.
